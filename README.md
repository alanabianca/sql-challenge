# SQL-Challenge: Pewlett Hackard Employee Data #

This repository includes two SQL files as well as an image.  

Six different CSV files are included in the data folder, all of which contain employee information in different tables.  

## ERD: Entity Relationship Diagram ##
A full diagram of the tables and their relationships can be found in file ERD.png

## Table Schemata ##
The EmployeeTable file should be read first, to create the blank tables neccessary that will be filled with the CSV datas.  

These tables are:
1. Employee Data
2. Department Names
3. Job Titles
4. Manager List
5. Employee Department Assignments
6. Employee Salaries

## Queries ##
The EmployeeQuery file contains eight different queries which can be run on the data after the tables are created and filled:

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
